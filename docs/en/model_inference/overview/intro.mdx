# Introduction

## Model Management

The Model Repository is a versioned storage and management hub designed specifically for LLM models on the Alauda AI platform. Built upon Git LFS technology, it provides an efficient and reliable model storage solution, spanning critical phases such as inference service deployment, model training fine-tuning, and model evaluation. Through the Model Repository, users can easily manage model versions, share model assets, and achieve full lifecycle management of models.


## Inference Service

The Inference Service is a core feature of the Alauda AI platform, dedicated to efficiently deploying LLM models as online inference services, supporting various invocation methods such as HTTP API and gRPC. Through the Inference Service, users can rapidly build LLM applications and provide stable, high-performance LLM capabilities externally.
