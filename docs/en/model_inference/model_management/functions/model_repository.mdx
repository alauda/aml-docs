# Model Repository
The core definition of the model repository feature is to provide a Git-based version-controlled storage system for machine learning models, enabling teams to manage model files, track versions, and collaborate across tenants. It leverages **Git LFS** for large file storage and integrates with MLOps workflows to bridge model development and deployment.

## Advantages
**Git-native Version Control**
- Track model changes via commits/branches/tags, ensuring reproducibility.

**High-Speed Transfers**
- CLI/Notebook uploads leverage internal network bandwidth.

**Cross-Tenant Sharing**
- Shared models can be accessed across namespaces (e.g., `public` as a model marketplace).

**Seamless Integration**
- Directly deploy models from the repository to inference services.

## Core Features
**Model Repository Creation & Deletion**
- Create an empty Git-backed repository with metadata (name/description/visibility).
- Delete models after dependency checks (e.g., ensure no active inference services).

**File Management**
1. **CLI/Git LFS**
    - Use `git lfs track` for large files (e.g., `*.bin`, `*.h5`).
    - Example:
      ```bash
      git clone <model_repo_url>
      git lfs install
      cp ~/local_model/* . && git add . && git commit -m "v1.0" && git push
      ```

**Version Control**
1. **Branching**
    - Maintain parallel versions (e.g., `experimental` vs `main` branches).
2. **Tagging**
    - Mark releases via UI/CLI (e.g., `git tag -a v2.0 -m "Stable release"`).
3. **Metadata Sync**
    - Auto-read `README.md` from the default branch for model descriptions.

**Cross-Tenant Sharing**
1. **Shared Models**
    - Set visibility to "Shared" during creation for inter-tenant access.
2. **Public Marketplace**
    - Use `public` namespace to publish open-source models (e.g., HuggingFace conversions).

**Integration with MLOps**
1. **Deployment Ready**
    - One-click inference service launch from tagged model versions.
2. **Notebook Integration**
    - Pull models directly into AML Notebooks for testing:
      ```bash
      !git clone https://aml-public/resnet50.git
      ```


## Technical Notes
1. **Git LFS Requirement**
    - Must include `.gitattributes` to specify LFS-tracked files (e.g., `*.zip filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs`).
2. **Default Branch Rules**
    - Misconfigured `README.md` metadata may block inference deployment.


## Create Model and Upload Model Files

Refer to [Upload Models Using Notebook](../how_to/upload_models_using_notebook.mdx) for detailed steps on uploading model files to the model repository.
