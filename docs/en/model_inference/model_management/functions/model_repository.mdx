# Model Repository
The core definition of the model repository feature is to provide a Git-based version-controlled storage system for machine learning models, enabling teams to manage model files, track versions, and collaborate across tenants. It leverages **Git LFS** for large file storage and integrates with MLOps workflows to bridge model development and deployment.  

## Advantages
**Git-native Version Control**  
- Track model changes via commits/branches/tags, ensuring reproducibility.  

**High-Speed Transfers**  
- CLI/Notebook uploads leverage internal network bandwidth.

**Cross-Tenant Sharing**
- Shared models can be accessed across namespaces (e.g., `public` as a model marketplace).
   
**Seamless Integration**
- Directly deploy models from the repository to inference services.

## Core Features
**Model Repository Creation & Deletion**  
- Create an empty Git-backed repository with metadata (name/description/visibility).  
- Delete models after dependency checks (e.g., ensure no active inference services).  

**File Management**  
1. **Web UI Upload**  
    - Drag-and-drop files/folders (limited to small/medium sizes).  
2. **CLI/Git LFS**  
    - Use `git lfs track` for large files (e.g., `*.bin`, `*.h5`).  
    - Example:  
    ```bash
    git clone <model_repo_url>
    git lfs install
    cp ~/local_model/* . && git add . && git commit -m "v1.0" && git push
    ```

**Version Control**  
1. **Branching**  
    - Maintain parallel versions (e.g., `experimental` vs `main` branches).  
2. **Tagging**  
    - Mark releases via UI/CLI (e.g., `git tag -a v2.0 -m "Stable release"`).  
3. **Metadata Sync**  
    - Auto-read `README.md` from the default branch for model descriptions.  

**Cross-Tenant Sharing**  
1. **Shared Models**  
    - Set visibility to "Shared" during creation for inter-tenant access.  
2. **Public Marketplace**  
    - Use `public` namespace to publish open-source models (e.g., HuggingFace conversions).  

**Integration with MLOps**  
1. **Deployment Ready**  
    - One-click inference service launch from tagged model versions.  
2. **Notebook Integration**  
    - Pull models directly into AML Notebooks for testing:  
    ```bash
    !git clone https://aml-public/resnet50.git
    ```  


## Technical Notes
1. **Git LFS Requirement**  
    - Must include `.gitattributes` to specify LFS-tracked files (e.g., `*.zip filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs`).  
2. **Default Branch Rules**  
    - Misconfigured `README.md` metadata may block inference deployment.  


## Create Model Repository

<Steps>

### Step 1: Define Repository Metadata

| Parameters   | Description                          |
| :----- | :--------------------------------- |
| Name | Required, Model Repository Name. |
| Labels | Custom tags for categorization and search. (e.g., "CV", "NLP", "production") |
| Description | Detailed explanation of the repository's purpose, model type, or usage guidelines. |

### Step 2: Create the Empty Repository

After defining the necessary information, proceed to `Create` the empty Model Repository.

### Step 3: Upload Model Files

You may upload model files through either of the following methods:

    * **Option 1: Web UI Upload**
        * Use the File Management interface to upload files
        * Drag and drop files/folders into the designated area
        * Supported formats: All model file types (.h5, .bin, .pt, etc.)
        * Progress tracking with real-time upload status

    * **Option 2: Git Command Line Upload**

        1.  **Get Repository Address:**
            * Navigate to Detail Info â†’ Basic Info
            * Copy the Git repository URL (e.g., https://\<your-domain\>/\<namespace\>/\<repo-name\>.git)

        2.  **Upload via Git:**

```bash

# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>

# Navigate to repo directory
cd <repo-name>

# Initialize Git LFS (if not already set up)
git lfs install

# Add model files (replace with your actual files)
cp -r /path/to/your/model/files/* .

# Configure LFS tracking (for large files)
git lfs track "*.h5" "*.bin" "*.pt"

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Add model files v1.0"

# Perform LFS migration check for existing large files (as seen in screenshot)
git lfs migrate info

# Migrate existing large files to LFS, specifically those above 100MB.
# NOTE: This command rewrites commit history. If the repository is already shared,
# coordinate with collaborators and push with --force, or prefer running it
# before the first public push.
# This limit (100MB) is chosen based on GitHub's recommended file size limits
# for optimal performance and handling, as documented at:
# https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github#file-size-limits
git lfs migrate import --above 100MB

git push origin main

```
