# Introduction

The Model Repository is a versioned storage and management hub designed specifically for LLM models on the Alauda AI platform. Built upon Git LFS technology, it provides an efficient and reliable model storage solution, spanning critical phases such as inference service deployment, model training fine-tuning, and model evaluation. Through the Model Repository, users can easily manage model versions, share model assets, and achieve full lifecycle management of models.

## Core Advantages

* **Precise Version Control:**
    * Leverages Git's branching and tagging capabilities to efficiently manage model versions, enabling users to track and revert model changes.
* **Efficient Large File Storage:**
    * Employs Git LFS technology to optimize the storage and transfer of large model files, enhancing model upload and download speeds.
* **Flexible Model Sharing:**
    * Supports both private and shared modes, catering to diverse model sharing needs and facilitating model exchange within and outside the enterprise.
    * Through namespace and sharing settings, it is easy to build a model market, to easy model distributions.
* **Seamless Workflow Integration:**
    * Deeply integrated with inference service deployment, model fine-tuning, and evaluation features, streamlining model deployment and application processes.

## Application Scenarios

* **Model Version Management:**
    * Version control for LLM models, ensuring traceability of model changes.
* **Model Asset Sharing:**
    * Sharing models within teams or enterprises to promote model reuse and collaboration.
    * Build a model market, easy to external model distributions.
* **Model Deployment and Application:**
    * Serves as the model source for inference service deployment, simplifying the model deployment process.
    * Functions as a storage center for model fine-tuning and evaluation, facilitating model iteration.
