# Inference Service Fails to Enter Running State

## Problem Description

After deploying an inference service, it remains in a non-running state for an extended period. The corresponding Pod is not created in the **Alauda Container Platform**'s **Workloads** section. However, the associated `Deployment` resource has been successfully created.

In the **Real-time Events** section of the `Deployment`, a similar error message is observed:

> `FailedCreate: Error creating: pods "gpt2-predictor-f677f684f-sjwq7" is forbidden: violates PodSecurity "baseline:latest": host namespaces (hostIPC=true)`

## Root Cause Analysis

This issue is caused by the **Pod Security Admission** mechanism, which is enabled on your Kubernetes cluster with a restrictive security policy. When the inference service `Pod` attempts to use privileged features, such as host namespaces (e.g., via `hostIPC=true`), the policy blocks its creation to prevent potential security vulnerabilities.

In this specific case, the use of `hostIPC=true` violates the "baseline" Pod Security Standard, which explicitly forbids using host namespaces to ensure Pod isolation.

## Solutions

To resolve this issue, we first recommend checking your inference service configuration. If your runtime doesn't strictly need privileged modes like `hostIPC: true`, the safest approach is to modify your workload configuration and remove these privileged requirements. This resolves the issue without compromising security.

If your workload absolutely requires these privileged features, follow these steps to adjust the security policy level:

1.  Navigate to the **Projects** view and select the **Project** containing your inference service.
2.  In the **Namespace** list, find the namespace where your service resides and click the **"..."** button on the right side of the row.
3.  From the dropdown menu, select **Update Pod Security Admission**.
4.  In the pop-up window, set the **Security Standard** for all three security modes (**Enforce**, **Audit**, and **Warn**) to `Privileged`.
5.  Click **Update** to save the changes.

## Summary

The failure of an inference service Pod to start is typically due to its configuration violating the namespace's Pod security policy. By adjusting the **Pod Security Admission** level of the **namespace** to `Privileged`, you allow the inference service Pod to be created and run successfully.
