# Feature Introduction

The core definition of the inference service feature is to deploy trained machine learning or deep learning models as online callable services, using protocols such as HTTP API or gRPC, enabling applications to use the model's prediction, classification, generation, and other features in real-time or in batches. This feature mainly addresses how to efficiently, stably, and conveniently deploy models to production environments after model training is completed, and provide scalable online services.

## Main Features

**Direct Model Deployment for Inference Services**

* Allows users to directly select specific versions of model files from the model repository and specify the inference runtime image to quickly deploy online inference services. The system automatically downloads, caches, and loads the model, starting the inference service. This simplifies the model deployment process and lowers the deployment threshold.

**Custom Image Deployment for Inference Services**

* Supports users in writing Dockerfiles to package models and their dependencies into custom images, and then deploy inference services through standard Kubernetes Deployments. This approach provides greater flexibility, allowing users to customize the inference environment according to their needs.

**Batch Operation of Inference Services**

* Supports batch operations on multiple inference services, such as batch starting, stopping, updating, and deleting.
* Able to support the creation, monitoring, and result export of batch inference tasks.
* Provides batch resource management, which can allocate and adjust the resources of inference services in batches.

**Inference Service Experience**

* Provides an interactive interface to facilitate user testing and experience of inference services.
* Supports multiple input and output formats to meet the needs of different application scenarios.
* Provides model performance evaluation tools to help users optimize model deployment.

**Inference Runtime Support**

* Integrates a variety of mainstream inference frameworks, such as vLLM, Seldon MLServer, etc., and supports user-defined inference runtimes.

:::tip

- vLLM: Optimized for large language models (LLMs) like DeepSeek/Qwen, featuring high-concurrency processing and enhanced throughput with superior resource efficiency.
- MLServer: Designed for traditional ML models (XGBoost/image classification), offering multi-framework compatibility and streamlined debugging.

:::

**Access Methods, Logs, Swagger, Monitoring, etc.**

* Provides multiple access methods, such as HTTP API and gRPC.
* Supports detailed log recording and analysis to facilitate user troubleshooting.
* Automatically generates Swagger documentation to facilitate user integration and invocation of inference services.
* Provides real-time monitoring and alarm features to ensure stable service operation.

## Create inference service

### Step 1

Custom publishing inference service requires manual setting of parameters. You can also create a "template" by combining input parameters for quick publishing of inference services.

**Parameter Descriptions for Different Task Types**

**Text Generation**

_Preset Parameters_

| Parameter | Data Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `do_sample` | bool | Whether to use sampling; if not, greedy decoding is used. |
| `max_new_tokens` | int | The maximum number of tokens to generate, ignoring tokens in the prompt. |
| `repetition_penalty` | float | Repetition penalty to control repeated content in the generated text; 1.0 means no repetition, 0 means repetition. |
| `temperature` | float | The randomness of the model for the next token when generating text; 1.0 is high randomness, 0 is low randomness. |
| `top_k` | int | When calculating the probability distribution of the next token, only consider the top k tokens with the highest probability. |
| `top_p` | float | Controls the cumulative probability distribution considered by the model when selecting the next token. |
| `use_cache` | bool | Whether to use the intermediate results calculated by the model during the generation process. |

_Other Parameters_

| Parameter | Data Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `max_length` | int | The maximum number of generated tokens. Corresponds to the number of tokens in the input prompt + `max_new_tokens`. If `max_new_tokens` is set, its effect is overridden by `max_new_tokens`. |
| `min_length` | int | The minimum number of generated tokens. Corresponds to the number of tokens in the input prompt + `min_new_tokens`. If `min_new_tokens` is set, its effect is overridden by `min_new_tokens`. |
| `min_new_tokens` | int | The minimum number of generated tokens, ignoring tokens in the prompt. |
| `early_stop` | bool | Controls the stopping condition for beam-based methods. True: generation stops when `num_beams` complete candidates appear. False: applies heuristics to stop generation when it is unlikely to find better candidates. |
| `num_beams` | int | Number of beams used for beam search. 1 means no beam search. |
| `max_time` | int | The maximum time allowed for calculation to run, in seconds. |
| `num_beam_groups` | int | Divides `num_beams` into groups to ensure diversity among different beam groups. |
| `diversity_penalty` | float | Effective when `num_beam_groups` is enabled. This parameter applies a diversity penalty between groups to ensure that the content generated by each group is as different as possible. |
| `penalty_alpha` | float | Contrastive search is enabled when `penalty_alpha` is greater than 0 and `top_k` is greater than 1. The larger the `penalty_alpha` value, the stronger the contrastive penalty, and the more likely the generated text is to meet expectations. If the `penalty_alpha` value is set too large, it may cause the generated text to be too uniform. |
| `typical_p` | float | Local typicality measures the similarity between the conditional probability of predicting the next target token and the expected conditional probability of predicting the next random token given the generated partial text. If set to a floating-point number less than 1, the smallest set of locally typical tokens whose probabilities add up to or exceed `typical_p` will be retained for generation. |
| `epsilon_cutoff` | float | If set to a floating-point number strictly between 0 and 1, only tokens with conditional probabilities greater than `epsilon_cutoff` will be sampled. Suggested values range from 3e-4 to 9e-4, depending on the model size. |
| `eta_cutoff` | float | Eta sampling is a hybrid of local typical sampling and epsilon sampling. If set to a floating-point number strictly between 0 and 1, a token will only be considered if it is greater than `eta_cutoff` or sqrt(`eta_cutoff`) * exp(-entropy(softmax(next_token_logits))). Suggested values range from 3e-4 to 2e-3, depending on the model size. |
| `repetition_penalty` | float | Parameter for repetition penalty. 1.0 means no penalty. |

**Text-to-Image**

_Preset Parameters_

| Parameter | Data Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `num_inference_steps` | int | The number of denoising steps. More denoising steps usually result in higher quality images but slower inference. |
| `use_cache` | bool | Whether to use the intermediate results calculated by the model during the generation process. |

_Other Parameters_

| Parameter | Data Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `height` | int | The height of the generated image, in pixels. |
| `width` | int | The width of the generated image, in pixels. |
| `guidance_scale` | float | Used to adjust the balance between quality and diversity of the generated image. Larger values increase diversity but reduce quality; suggested range is 7 to 8.5. |
| `negative_prompt` | str or List[str] | Used to guide what content should not be included in the image generation. |
