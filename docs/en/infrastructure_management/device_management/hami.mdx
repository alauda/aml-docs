# About Alauda Build of Hami

Heterogeneous AI Computing Virtualization Middleware (HAMi), formerly known as k8s-vGPU-scheduler, is an "all-in-one" chart designed to manage Heterogeneous AI Computing Devices in a k8s cluster. It can provide the ability to share Heterogeneous AI devices among tasks.

Note: You DON'T need to install HAMi when using volcano-vgpu for Fine-tuning or Pre-training jobs, only use
Volcano vGPU device-plugin is good enough. It can provide device-sharing mechanism for NVIDIA devices managed by Volcano.
