The tenants supported by AML are K8s namespaces, which need to be managed in **Namespace Management** before they can be used as tenants of AML.

The steps to create a namespace and add users to this namespace are as follows:

1. Log in to the ACP platform as an administrator
1. Create a namespace
    1. Enter ACP **Project Management**
    1. Create or select an existing project, and then click to enter the current project details page.
    1. Click **Namespace** > **Namespace**
    1. Click **Create Namespace**
1. Assign namespace permissions to users
    1. Enter ACP **Platform Management**
    1. Select **User Role Management** > **User Management** from the navigation
    1. Create a new user or select the user to be added to this namespace
    1. Click the **Configure Role** tab and click the **Add Role** button
    1. Configure AML-related roles for the user and select the previously created namespace
        - Editor: Users can create and delete workloads in the namespace and use resource quotas such as CPU and GPU to complete work
        - Owner: Users have the permission to manage this AML namespace
        - Viewer: Users can only view the resources of the namespace and cannot create or delete workloads
1. Return to AML, click **Manage Namespace** in **Platform Management** > **Namespace Management**, and select the previously created namespace to complete the management
