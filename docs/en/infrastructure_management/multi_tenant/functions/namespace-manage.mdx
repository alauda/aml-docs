# Namespace Management

The tenants supported by Alauda AI are Kubernetes namespaces, which need to be managed in **Namespace Management** before they can be used as tenants of Alauda AI.

The procedure to create a namespace and add users to this namespace are as follows:

1. Log into the Web Console as an administrator
2. Create a namespace
    1. Switch to the **Projects** view
    2. Create or select an existing project, and then click to enter the current project details page.
    3. Click **Namespace** > **Namespace**
    4. Click **Create Namespace**
    5. In **Create Namespace** page, under **Pod Security Policies** section, select **privileged** as security standard for all three `enforce`, `audit` and `warn` security modes.

        :::warning

        Security standard should be either blank or **privileged**, otherwise AI Inference workload may refuse to run.

        :::

3. Assign namespace permissions to users
    1. Switch to the **Administrator** view
    2. Select **User Role Management** > **User Management** from the navigation
    3. Create a new user or select the user to be added to this namespace
    4. Click the **Configure Role** tab and click the **Add Role** button
    5. Configure Alauda AI-related roles for the user and select the previously created namespace
        - Editor: Users can create and delete workloads in the namespace and use resource quotas such as CPU and GPU to complete work
        - Owner: Users have the permission to manage this Alauda AI namespace
        - Viewer: Users can only view the resources of the namespace and cannot create or delete workloads
4. Return to Alauda AI, click **Namespace Manage** in **Admin** > **Management Namespace**, and select the previously created namespace to complete the management
