# Uninstall

This document guides you through the complete uninstallation of Alauda AI and its related components from your cluster. The uninstallation process is divided into two main parts: first, uninstalling the optional **Alauda AI Model Serving** and its instances, and then, uninstalling the core **Alauda AI** instance and Operator.

If you don't need the Serverless capability or want to use only the essential core features to save resources, you can choose to perform only the first step to remove the **Alauda AI Model Serving** components.

**Note:** Before proceeding with the uninstallation, ensure you have backed up all important data and models. The uninstallation process will permanently delete all resources and configurations associated with Alauda AI.
