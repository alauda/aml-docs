# Quickstart

This section provides a quickstart example for creating an AI Agent with Llama Stack.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher (if not satisfied, refer to [FAQ: How to prepare Python 3.12 in Notebook](#how-to-prepare-python-312-in-notebook))
- Llama Stack Server installed and running via Operator (see [Install Llama Stack](./install))
- Access to a Notebook environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab)
- Python environment with `llama-stack-client` and required dependencies installed
- API key for the LLM provider (e.g., DeepSeek API key)

## Quickstart Example

A simple example of creating an AI Agent with Llama Stack is available in the following resources:

- **Notebook**:[Llama Stack Quick Start Demo](/llama-stack/llama-stack_quickstart.ipynb)

Download the notebook and upload it to a Notebook environment to run.

The notebook demonstrates:

- Connecting to Llama Stack Server and client setup
- Tool definition using the `@client_tool` decorator (weather query tool example)
- Client connection to Llama Stack Server
- Model selection and Agent creation with tools and instructions
- Agent execution with session management and streaming responses
- Result handling and display
- Optional FastAPI deployment example

## FAQ

### How to prepare Python 3.12 in Notebook

1. Download the pre-compiled Python installation package:

   ```bash
   wget -O /tmp/python312.tar.gz https://github.com/astral-sh/python-build-standalone/releases/download/20260114/cpython-3.12.12+20260114-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-install_only.tar.gz
   ```

2. Extract with:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/python312
   tar -xzf /tmp/python312.tar.gz -C ~/python312 --strip-components=1
   ```

3. Install and Register Kernel:

   ```bash
   export PATH="${HOME}/python312/bin:${PATH}"

   python3 -m pip install ipykernel
   python3 -m ipykernel install --user --name python312 --display-name "Python 3.12"
   ```

4. Switch kernel in the notebook page.

**Note**: When executing python and pip commands directly in the notebook page, the default python will still be used. You need to specify the full path to use the python312 version commands.
