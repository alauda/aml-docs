# Introduction

Workbench, aka Notebook 2.0, is the next evolution of Kubeflow Notebooks. It makes running IDEs on Kubernetes for ML/AI significantly better for users and cluster admins alike.

Kubeflow Notebooks provides a way to run web-based development environments inside your Kubernetes cluster by running them inside Pods.

Some key features include:

- Native support for JupyterLab, RStudio (in the feature), and Visual Studio Code (code-server).
- Users can create notebook containers directly in the cluster, rather than locally on their workstations.
- Admins can provide standard notebook images for their organization with required packages pre-installed.
- Access control is managed by Kubeflow's RBAC, enabling easier notebook sharing across the organization.
