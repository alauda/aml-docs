# Introduction

## Workbench

Workbench manages web IDE instances like Jupyter Notebooks, code-server, or RStudio. AI/ML developers and data scientists can use cluster resources (like GPUs) and connect to in-cluster services to create general ML jobs and pipelines.

Workbench uses "Kubeflow Notebook 2.0" as its backend to create cloud IDE containers. If you are familiar with "Kubeflow Notebook", it's easy to start using Workbench.

Some key features include:

- Native support for JupyterLab, Visual Studio Code (code-server), and RStudio (in the future).
- Users can create notebook containers directly in the cluster, rather than locally on their workstations.
- Admins can provide standard notebook images for their organization with required packages pre-installed.
- Access control is managed by Kubeflow's RBAC, enabling easier notebook sharing across the organization.

## WorkspaceKind

- this is the resource that cluster-admins create
- it specifies the template for a Workspace (e.g. "JupyterLab", "VSCode", "RStudio")
- initially, we would only support a "podTemplate" kind, which is very similar to the existing Notebook CRD, but in the future, we could support other types of templates (e.g. "helmTemplate")
