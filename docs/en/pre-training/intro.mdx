# Introduction

Training offers a no-code/low-code UI to run training task. Using extensible templates, users can configure models, data sources, resources, and hyperparameters, then submit and monitor training tasks with logs, metrics, and curves. Training outputs are pushed to a model repository for registration or deployment, while custom templates support most model types and training paradigms.
