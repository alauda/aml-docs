# Introduction

## Logging Introduction

The Logging module in Alauda AI's Monitoring & Ops suite is a real-time logging solution designed for inference services in MLOps/LLMOps/GenOps workflows. It provides instant visibility into the operational status of replica pods powering your AI services, enabling efficient debugging and observability. By streaming container logs with millisecond-level latency and offering built-in analysis tools, it helps users maintain service health while accelerating incident response.

## Logging Advantages

The core advantages of the Logging module are:

- **Real-time Streaming**  
  Automatically captures and displays new log entries from replica pods as they occur, with low latency. Supports live tailing for continuous monitoring of service behavior during model inference.

- **Unified Operations Interface**  
  Embeds directly within the inference service management console, correlating log data with deployment metrics, model versions, and infrastructure status for holistic troubleshooting.

## Logging Application Scenarios

Key use cases for the Logging module include:

- **Production Incident Response**  
  Quickly diagnose model serving errors by searching exception stack traces within individual replica pods, with timestamp alignment to deployment events and traffic spikes.

- **Continuous Delivery Validation**  
  Monitor rolling update processes in real-time, verifying new model deployments by watching for successful health checks and initialization messages across pod replicas.
