Welcome to the AML (AllStack Machine Learning) platform! AML provides you with the best practices for large models and MLOps platforms, helping you to efficiently complete tasks in multiple scenarios such as large model applications, AI applications, and machine learning. Based on the AML platform, you can quickly complete the following common tasks:

- Model storage and versioning management
- Model (large model) reasoning service release and operation
- Model (large model) training and fine-tuning
- Model evaluation
- Dataset annotation and version management
- Agent orchestration, AI application development and release
- Customized model development and release

In this user manual, we will introduce you to the various functions of the AML platform so that you can make full use of the tools and services we provide. Whether you are a data scientist, machine learning engineer, or application developer, I believe that our platform can bring convenience and efficiency to your work!

### Introduction to MLOps and LLMOps

MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) defines a series of principles and tool forms in the development, training, release, and operation and maintenance processes of machine learning, large models, or other AI applications, becoming the best practice for releasing AI applications efficiently, accurately, and traceably.

AML not only covers the tool support for the subject process in the MLOps process, but also provides a more concise user interface for the practice of LLMOps (Large Language Model Operations). From the release of inference services for large models, to the construction of intelligent agents and applications, to model fine-tuning training and other capabilities, all are completed in a **codeless** way. In addition, **advanced** capabilities that support MLOps are also provided, supporting algorithm developers and data scientists to use cloud-based Notebook IDEs to write code, build MLOps workflows, track each training, and so on.
