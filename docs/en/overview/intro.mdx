1. What is Introduction

The "Introduction" section serves as the opening of the product documentation or functional module, providing an overall description of the product or feature. It covers core concepts, main functionalities, target users, and intended uses, giving readers a clear initial understanding.

Typically, we decide whether to include the introduction, advantages, and feature overview in one document based on the overall length of the article. For complex products (such as platform products that include multiple core modules), it is recommended to split these contents into separate documents; for single functional modules, they can be combined in the same document.

2. Importance of the Introduction

There may be many points involved in a product or functional module, and adding an introduction at the beginning can:

- Unified Understanding: It can serve as a starting point for providing a consistent cognition, reducing communication errors.
- Guiding Reading: It provides readers with a clear product background, facilitating a deeper understanding of subsequent detailed content.
- Enhancing Efficiency: It decreases the time spent on repetitive explanations regarding the basics of the product.

3. How to Conceive the Introduction Section

- Concise and Clear: Summarize the core points of the product using succinct language, avoiding verbosity.
- Highlight Key Points: Emphasize the unique selling points and main functionalities of the product.
- Reader-Oriented: Consider the background of the target audience and provide information they care about.

4. Special Aspects of the Introduction

This template offers a standardized framework for describing functional modules within the documentation. By organizing content structurally and expressing it clearly, it helps the team better convey the product's functional value, enabling users to quickly comprehend and utilize the product functionalities.

We will notice some differences between product-level introductions and module-level introductions:

Characteristics of Product-Level Introductions

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly state the product's position and competitive advantages within the industry.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all core modules and functional systems included in the product.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The applicable scenarios of the product will be more comprehensive and need to be jointly explained based on the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of Module-Level Introductions

- **Module Positioning**: Explain the role and responsibilities of the module within the product.
- **Module Features**: Focus on describing the characteristics and advantages of the individual module.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Highlight the applicable scenarios supported by the individual module.
