### Introduction to MLOps and LLMOps

MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) delineates a series of principles and tool forms in the development, training, release, and operation and maintenance processes of machine learning, large models, or other AI applications, becoming the best practice for releasing AI applications efficiently, accurately, and traceably.

Alauda AI not only covers the tool support for the subject process in the MLOps process, but also furnishes a more concise user interface for the practice of LLMOps (Large Language Model Operations). From the release of inference services for large models, to the construction of intelligent agents and applications,all are completed in a **codeless** way.
