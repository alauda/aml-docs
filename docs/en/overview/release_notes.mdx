# Release Notes

## AI 1.5.0

### **Features and Enhancements**

#### Langflow Agent Development
Leverage Langflow's upper-layer UI orchestration (powered by LangChain's foundational framework) to rapidly develop AI Agents for intelligent applications like expert Q&A, RAG-powered search, and workflow automation.

#### Featureform Feature Store Integration
Featuform serves as a dedicated feature store, resolving performance inconsistencies in AI model training-inference pipelines caused by divergent data processing logic through centralized feature definition, version-controlled storage, and real-time feature serving.

#### Evidently Data Drift Detection Capability Integration
Evidently, as a AI model monitoring component, provides real-time data drift detection functionality. It continuously analyzes statistical discrepancies between online feature distributions and training data to automatically identify potential risks of data distribution shifts.

#### Workbench Plugin Enhances
The legacy version of the Workbench plugin provided foundational support for model development environments but required users to manually configure environment definitions (e.g., Jupyter Notebook/VS Code container images) and development environment permission policies, resulting in a cumbersome operational workflow.

The new version introduces targeted optimizations for this scenario:

1、Pre-integrated Standardized Development Environments
Built-in, ready-to-use Jupyter Notebook environment templates eliminate manual image downloading and synchronization steps.
2、Default Permission Management Configuration
Provides predefined baseline permission policies for development environments while supporting customization of permission scopes via configuration files.

#### Fine-tuning Plugin Reconstruction and Stability Enhancement
The new Fine-tuning plugin has undergone an architectural-level reconstruction, with a primary focus on optimizing the stability of training workflows, introducing distributed training capabilities, and adjusting the built-in template strategy:

1、The built-in finetune-text-generation-llamafactory template supports fine-tuning tasks for mainstream text-generation models.
2、The three template types previously provided in older versions image classification, text classification, and text-to-image are no longer included as built-in options. Users can implement these functionalities through custom template solutions.

#### Training Plugin Reconstruction and Stability Enhancement
The new Training plugin has undergone an architectural-level reconstruction, with a primary focus on optimizing the stability of training workflows, introducing distributed training capabilities


### **Deprecated and Removed Features**

#### Deprecation of Image Management Functionality in Model Repository
In Alauda AI v1.5.0, the original Image Management(model image building and image-based inference service)capabilities will be officially deprecated. These features were initially provided as experimental functionalities in earlier releases but, due to identified stability risks and usability concerns, have been evaluated and determined to no longer warrant ongoing maintenance.
