# Introduction

## Dify

Dify is an open-source LLM application development platform that provides an intuitive interface for AI workflows, RAG pipelines, agent capabilities, and model management. It enables developers and non-technical users to build, deploy, and manage AI applications through a web UI.

Dify helps teams quickly build and iterate on LLM-powered applications: from simple chatbots (Assistant) and text generators to complex RAG pipelines and multi-step agent workflows. For deployment components and prerequisites (API, Worker, Web, PostgreSQL, Redis, vector store, etc.), see [Install Dify](../install).

## Core Concepts

- **Application** – The basic unit for organizing LLM capabilities. Types include Assistant (chat), Text Generator, Agent (reasoning and tools), and Workflow/Chatflow (visual pipelines). Each app can be published as a Web App or consumed via API.
- **Workflow** – Visual, node-based pipelines (LLM, retrieval, code, logic nodes) for building multi-step AI logic with drag-and-drop.
- **Knowledge Base (RAG)** – Datasets built from documents or URLs, with chunking, embedding, and retrieval to ground LLM responses in your data. (In the Helm chart, **pgvector** is the supported vector store.)
- **Agent** – Applications that use tools and multi-step reasoning; deploy as Web App or API.

For a concise list of main features, see [Main Features](features). For installation and configuration on the platform, see [Install Dify](../install).
