# Enable CDI in Containerd

CDI (Container Device Interface) provides a standard mechanism for device vendors to describe what is required to provide access to a specific resource such as a GPU beyond a simple device name.

CDI support is enabled by default in containerd version 2.0 and later. Earlier versions, starting from 1.7.0, support for this feature requires manual activation.

## Steps to Enable CDI in Containerd (1.7.0 <= version < 2.0.0)

1. Update containerd configuration.
    Edit the configuration file:
    ```bash
    vi /etc/containerd/config.toml
    ```
    Add or modify the following section:
    ```toml
    [plugins."io.containerd.grpc.v1.cri"]
      enable_cdi = true
    ```
2. Restart containerd.
    ```bash
    systemctl restart containerd
    systemctl status containerd
    ```
    Ensure the service is running correctly.

3. Verify CDI is Enabled.
    ```bash
    journalctl -u containerd | grep "EnableCDI:true"
    ```
    Wait a moment, if there are logs, it means the setup was successful.
