:::tip

If the module needs to be deployed separately, deployment documentation must be provided; otherwise, it can be omitted.

The deployment documentation should include the deployment process, deployment configuration, uninstallation process, and more. If the content of the deployment documentation is extensive, the deployment documentation can be transformed into a table of contents, which can be divided into several documents for introduction.

You can visit [Deployment](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/installation/example.html) to see an example of the corresponding documentation.
