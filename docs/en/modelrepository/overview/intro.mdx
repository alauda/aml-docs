1. What is an Introduction

The "Introduction" section is the preface of the product documentation or functional module, providing an overall description of the product or function. It covers core concepts, main features, target users, and expected uses, giving readers a clear initial understanding.

We generally decide whether to combine the introduction, advantages, and feature overview based on the overall length of the document. For complex products (such as platform products that include multiple core modules), it is recommended to separate these contents into independent documents; for single functional modules, they can be merged into the same document.

2. Importance of the Introduction

There may be many points involved in a product or functional module, and adding an introduction at the beginning can:

- Unified Understanding: Serve as an initial offering of a consistent understanding, reducing communication errors.
- Guide Reading: Provide readers with a clear product background, facilitating deeper understanding of subsequent detailed content.
- Enhance Efficiency: Reduce the time spent on repeated explanations regarding basic product understanding.

3. How to Conceptualize the Introduction Section

- Conciseness: Summarize the core points of the product using concise language, avoiding verbosity.
- Highlight Key Points: Emphasize the unique selling points and main features of the product.
- Audience-focused: Consider the background of the target audience and provide the information that concerns them.

4. The Uniqueness of the Introduction

This template provides a standardized framework for describing functional modules in documentation. Through structured content organization and clear expression, it helps the team better convey the value of product features, enabling users to quickly understand and utilize product functionalities.

We may find some differences between the product-level introduction and the module-level introduction:

Characteristics of Product-Level Introduction

- **Product Positioning**: Clearly state the product's position in the industry and its competitive advantages.
- **Complete Ecosystem**: Describe all core modules and functional systems included in the product.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: The applicable scenarios for the product are more comprehensive, requiring combined explanation according to the characteristics of different modules.

Characteristics of Module-Level Introduction

- **Module Positioning**: Explain the role and responsibilities of the module within the product.
- **Module Features**: Focus on describing the characteristics and advantages of the single module.
- **Applicable Scenarios**: Highlight the applicable scenarios supported by the single module.
