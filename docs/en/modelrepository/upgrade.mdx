:::tip

If the parent module requires a manual upgrade operation separately, an upgrade document is needed; otherwise, it may not be provided.

The upgrade document should include the upgrade process, upgrade configuration, rollback process, etc.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade processes for different versions, the upgrade document should be organized into a directory that provides the upgrade documents for different versions (for example: "3.10 Upgrade Guide", "3.18 Upgrade Guide").

You can visit [Upgrade](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) to view an example of the corresponding document.
