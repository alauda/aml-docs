                                Effect indicates the taint effect to match. Empty means match all taint effects.
                                When specified, allowed values are NoSchedule, PreferNoSchedule and NoExecute.

                                Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys.
                                If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.

                                Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                                Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                                tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                                TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be

                                it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                                negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                        observedGeneration represents the .metadata.generation that the condition was set based upon.
                        For instance, if .metadata.generation is currently 12, but the .status.conditions[x].observedGeneration is 9, the condition is out of date
                        with respect to the current state of the instance.

                        and whether the values are considered a guaranteed API.
                        The value should be a CamelCase string.

                        Many .condition.type values are consistent across resources like Available, but because arbitrary conditions can be
                        useful (see .node.status.conditions), the ability to deconflict is important.
