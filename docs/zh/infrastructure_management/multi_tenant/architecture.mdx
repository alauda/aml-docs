:::tip
The purpose of writing the "Functional Architecture" document is to help users understand the core processes and concepts of the functionality.

It is recommended that "concepts" introduced in the architecture link to the corresponding chapters in the "Core Concepts" section below. If the introduced "concepts" are relatively simple and do not require a separate document for explanation, a brief description can be provided in the architecture document.

For complex processes, it is advisable to write a separate article titled "In-Depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory for a more detailed introduction.

You can refer to the [Architecture Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/arch/module_arch_example.html) for sample documentation.

# Architecture

Please include one or more technical architecture diagrams about the functionality, which can include the following content:

- Core components: such as Operator, tasks, middleware, etc., and illustrate the relationships and functions among various components in the diagram.
- Data flow: such as introduced resources, dependencies among resources, and the consumption flow of the resources, etc.
- Deployment architecture: such as multi-cluster deployment, high availability design, etc.

Add a description of the image below the architecture diagram to explain its meaning and the functions of each part within it.

Provide a brief introduction to the concepts introduced in the architecture diagram. If a certain concept requires more detailed explanation, please link to the corresponding chapter in the "Core Concepts" section.
