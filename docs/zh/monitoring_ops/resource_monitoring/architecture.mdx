:::tip
The purpose of writing the "Functional Architecture" document is to help users understand the core processes and concepts of the function.

It is recommended to link to the corresponding chapters of "Core Concepts" for the "concepts" introduced in the architecture. If the introduced "concept" is relatively simple and does not require a separate document, a brief description can be made in the architecture document.

For complex processes, it is recommended to write a separate article titled "In-Depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory to introduce it in a more straightforward manner.

You can access the [Architecture Document Example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/arch/module_arch_example.html) to view the example document.

# Architecture

Please add one or more technical architecture diagrams about the function, which may include the following contents:

- Core Components: Such as Operators, Tasks, Middleware, etc., and illustrate the connections and roles of each component in the diagram.
- Data Flow: For example, the introduced resources, dependencies between resources, and how resources are consumed, etc.
- Deployment Architecture: Such as multi-cluster deployment, high availability design, etc.

Add descriptions for the image below the architecture diagram, explaining the meaning of the image and the role of its various parts.

Provide a brief introduction to the concepts introduced in the architecture diagram. If a certain concept requires more detailed explanation, please link to the corresponding chapter of "Core Concepts".
