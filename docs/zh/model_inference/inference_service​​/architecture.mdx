:::tip
The purpose of writing a "Functional Architecture" document is to assist users in understanding the core processes and concepts of the feature.

It is advisable to link the "concepts" introduced in the architecture to the corresponding sections in the "Core Concepts" below. If the "concepts" introduced are relatively simple and do not require a separate document, a brief explanation can be provided within the architecture document.

For complex processes, it is recommended to write a separate article titled "In-depth Understanding of XXXX" in the current directory to provide a comprehensive introduction.

You can refer to the [architecture document example](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/arch/module_arch_example.html) for sample documentation.

# Architecture

Please add one or more technical architecture diagrams related to the feature. The diagrams may include the following content:

- Core components: For example, Operators, Tasks, Middleware, etc., highlighting the relationships and functions of each component within the diagram.
- Data flow: For instance, the introduced resources, dependencies between resources, and the flow of resource consumption.
- Deployment architecture: For example, multi-cluster deployment, high availability design, etc.

Add a description below the architecture diagram to explain the meaning of the image and the role of each part.

Provide a brief introduction to the concepts introduced in the architecture diagram. If a specific concept requires a more detailed explanation, please link to the corresponding section in the "Core Concepts."
