:::tip

If the parent module requires manual upgrade operations, it needs to provide upgrade documentation; otherwise, it can be omitted.

The upgrade documentation should include upgrade processes, upgrade configurations, rollback processes, etc.

If there are significant differences in the upgrade processes of different versions, the upgrade documentation should be turned into a directory, where different version upgrade documents (e.g., "3.10 Upgrade Guide", "3.18 Upgrade Guide") are provided.

You can visit [升级](https://product-doc-guide.alauda.cn/template/upgrade/example.html) to view examples of the corresponding documents.
